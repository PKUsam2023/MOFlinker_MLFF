## Instruction

The "deploy.pth" file is the machine learning model for structure optimization. 

The "data" directory contains ligands and their adsorption structures which can be used to calculate the adsorption energies of ethane and ethylene.

Most importantly, we just provide our trained model and Partial data set. Researchers interested in accessing the model and dataset can submit a formal request detailing the intended use of the model and data to F.P. (panfeng@pkusz.edu.cn).
